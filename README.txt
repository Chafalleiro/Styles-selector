Changes the styles by classes dinamically. Needs some knowledge about the css styles of the templates to alter.

== Description ==

Plugin for altering several items in a theme in order to change the visualization. You can choose which kind of item will be,
an individual CSS element or an entire class by specifing the type of element.
If you have a theme switcher, you can also alter several themes (up to five).
Once you have saved the themes, their elements and the name of the option, a widget will be created with a menu list of the options you did,
so the users can set the display options they want.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `styleselector` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
